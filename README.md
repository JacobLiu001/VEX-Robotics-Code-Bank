# VEX-Robotics-Code-Bank
## This is a code bank for VEX Cortex 2.0.
### Most of it should be for the CLAWBOT design (Note that it might not be the 'standard' one, be sure to check the '#pragma' preprocessors of each program and wire your own bot or modify the program accordingly)
The folders are named in the format of: YYYYMMDD, and should be automatically arranged in chronological order.

Feel free to fork my project!
